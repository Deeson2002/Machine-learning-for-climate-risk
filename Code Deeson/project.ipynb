    "# Data Challenge: Predicting the SWI Uniforme from SWI (France)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to SWI and SWI Uniforme\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we would like to explore the relationship between **SWI (Soil Wetness Index)** and **SWI uniforme** in the context of forecasting **natural catastrophes**, particularly **droughts** (*sécheresse*) in France.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are SWI and SWI uniforme?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SWI (Soil Wetness Index)** is a numerical indicator designed to capture the **moisture content in soils**. It reflects how saturated the soil is, which is crucial for understanding the potential for **droughts or floods**.\n",
    "- It is computed from hydrological models that integrate **precipitation**, **evapotranspiration**, and crucially, **soil properties**—especially the **clay content** (in French: *argile*), which influences the soil's **water retention capacity**.\n",
    "- **SWI uniforme** (Soil Wetness Index under uniform soil assumption) is a *standardized version* of the SWI that assumes **uniform soil characteristics** across France (same soil texture, composition everywhere). It removes spatial variability due to soil heterogeneity and is used as a **neutral benchmark**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who produces them and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **SWI** (Soil Wetness Index) is produced by **Météo-France** based on the **SAFRAN** model and is made available **daily** (_SIM quotidienne_). It reflects actual soil moisture and accounts for local soil properties such as clay content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **SWI uniforme** is also produced by **Météo-France**, but under the assumption of a **homogeneous soil profile across France**. It is released **once a year**, typically in **April–May of the following year**, and serves as the **official reference** for drought-related policy and insurance decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **interministerial commission** uses the SWI uniforme as part of the **CatNat (Catastrophes Naturelles)** compensation process. This uniform soil assumption ensures **fairness and comparability** across regions, especially given the limited spatial resolution and coverage of available soil data (e.g., BRGM maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are these indices important?\n",
    "\n",
    "These indices are widely used by researchers, insurers, and public authorities to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forecast droughts** and estimate their impact on infrastructure and buildings.\n",
    "- **Assess financial risk** and plan insurance reserves.\n",
    "- Trigger or reject **CatNat eligibility** for affected communes.\n",
    "- Compare actual drought impacts (SWI) with reference drought levels (SWI uniforme).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-world challenge behind this project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates the practical challenge faced by **insurers** (e.g., Allianz) and **public bodies**:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **How can we estimate the SWI Uniforme months before it is officially published**, using available SWI data and other spatial indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a forecast is critical for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anticipating the **number of eligible communes**,\n",
    "- Estimating potential **financial losses** in the year ahead,\n",
    "- Helping in **portfolio planning** and **risk management** decisions by September of the current year, not April of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will also allow you to reflect on the **influence of soil composition** (particularly clay content) on SWI values and drought modeling."

    "## The BRGM Soil Map and Its Role in SWI Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The **BRGM map** refers to the geoscientific datasets produced by the **Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières** (BRGM), the French national geological survey. These datasets include detailed information about the **composition of soils** across France — particularly the **percentage of clay (argile)**, which plays a central role in soil behavior during wet and dry periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why is the BRGM map important for SWI?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Soil Wetness Index (SWI)** depends on how soils retain and release water. Soils with a high clay content can **retain moisture longer**, which affects the evolution of the SWI after precipitation events. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the **SWI uniforme** is computed with the assumption of a **uniform soil composition across the country**, which removes local variations like those captured in the BRGM map.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the **difference between SWI and SWI uniforme** can often be explained by the local variability in soil clay content, making the BRGM map a key dataset for interpreting and modeling drought risk indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Download Soil Clay Content Data (RGA - BRGM 2020)\n",

    "## Administrative Boundaries of France\n",
    "\n",
    "The **administrative division of the French territory** is structured into several hierarchical levels, each serving different roles in governance, statistics, and spatial analysis. Understanding these units is essential when working with geographic data such as **SWI**, **SWI uniforme**, or **soil composition**, since analyses often need to be aggregated or compared across these boundaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Arrondissement départemental** → A subdivision of a department, mainly used for administrative management.  \n",
    "- **Département** → Intermediate level of governance (101 in total, including overseas). Each department has a prefect and a council.  \n",
    "- **Région** → The largest administrative division (18 in total). Regions handle economic planning, transport, and regional development.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Understanding & Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to prediction, your first task is to perform a **comprehensive exploratory analysis** of the available data. This should include both **quantitative** and **qualitative** insights on drought behavior across space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Load & Prepare the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load historical **SWI (Safran)** and **SWI Uniforme** datasets.\n",
    "- Load **soil composition data** (clay percentage from BRGM).\n",
    "- Load **administrative boundaries** (communes, départements, régions).\n",
    "- Link the SWI and SWI uniforme data to **commune polygons** and **soil maps**, so you can analyze at regional scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute **summary statistics** (mean, std, min, max) for both SWI and SWI Uniforme.\n",
    "- Evaluate the **temporal evolution** of SWI:\n",
    "  - Identify trends across **years** (e.g., are droughts more frequent after 2010?),\n",
    "  - Explore **monthly patterns** (e.g., which months are driest).\n",
    "- Perform **regional aggregation** (mean SWI by region, month, or year).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Qualitative Regional Drought Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify **which regions are most and least affected by drought**:\n",
    "  - Expect **Southwest** (Bordeaux, Montpellier) to show more frequent/severe drought,\n",
    "  - **Brittany** (Bretagne) likely less affected, small presence of clay in the soil (to be checked)\n",
    "  - **Grand Est** may show **increasing drought trends** in recent years.\n",
    "- Visualize regional variability using **choropleth maps** or **ranking plots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. SWI vs. SWI Uniforme — Relationship Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify how strongly **SWI and SWI Uniforme are correlated** (per region or grid point).\n",
    "- Study the **spatial divergence**:\n",
    "  - Map where the two indicators **differ the most** across France.\n",
    "- Investigate how **soil properties** (e.g., clay content) **explain this divergence**:\n",
    "  - Are differences larger in clay-rich soils?\n",
    "  - Do differences align with regions that vary strongly in soil composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This analysis will help you understand the **behavioral difference between the indicators**, which is crucial for modeling and for interpreting why a commune may or may not be declared in drought.\n",
    "- Load and explore historical **SWI (Safran)** and **SWI Uniforme** datasets.\n",
    "- Link the SWI grid data to **commune polygons** and **soil maps (BRGM)**.\n",
    "- Compute **summary statistics** and visualize the spatial variability of both indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Modeling the SWI Uniforme\n",
    "- Build a predictive model (e.g., linear regression, random forest, neural network) that estimates **SWI Uniforme** from:\n",
    "  - SWI (Safran),\n",
    "  - Soil characteristics,\n",
    "  - Climatic or geographic covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance using past years where both SWI and SWI Uniforme are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Interpretation & Communication\n",
    "- Map and interpret areas with the largest errors.\n",
    "- Discuss the **potential policy implications** (e.g., fairness in drought declarations, bias due to soil heterogeneity).\n",
    "- Reflect on how this model could help anticipate **CatNat eligibility** for droughts.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to predict whether a location (commune or grid cell) will experience an **extreme geotechnical drought**, based on **SWI uniforme** values. The challenge is to simulate the eligibility rules used by the **interministerial commission** (CatNat) — which are based not on fixed values, but on **statistical thresholds**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Drought Definition Using the 25% Quantile\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by computing the **25th percentile (Q1)** of historical SWI uniforme values for each location and quarter (e.g., Q2: April–June).  \n",
    "Any year where the SWI uniforme falls **below this 25% threshold** is marked as an **extreme drought**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This first task defines drought in a broad sense and helps initialize your binary classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Drought Definition Using the 5% Quantile\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we apply a **stricter criterion**: we compute the **5th percentile** of SWI uniforme for each location and quarter.  \n",
    "Years below this threshold are classified as **very extreme droughts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This step simulates rare but impactful events, refining your model's sensitivity to extreme low moisture conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Official Rule (“Règle Métier”) from Météo-France\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we implement the official drought definition from the **Météo-France 2019 report**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“On considère que la durée de retour de la sécheresse géotechnique est supérieure ou égale à 25 ans si l’indicateur du trimestre considéré se classe au 1er ou au 2ᵉ rang parmi les indicateurs calculés sur les 50 dernières années pour ce trimestre.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "Translated: A **drought event** is defined when the **SWI uniforme** for a quarter is among the **two lowest values over the past 50 years** — corresponding to a **return period of at least 25 years**.\n",

    "\n",
    "> This is the most realistic and policy-relevant definition. Your final binary label will be:\n",

    "- Administrative requests and delays,\n",
